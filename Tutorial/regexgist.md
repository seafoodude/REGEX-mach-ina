# REGEX-mach-ina

In this gist, I will be describing a regular expression pattern in Javascript.

## Summary

The regular expression pattern I will be describing is `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`. It is used to match hexadecimal color codes in the format of a "#" symbol, followed by either 3 or 6 characters.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify the position of a match within the string.

The "^" anchor used at the beginning of this regular expression indicates that the match must occur at the start of the string, and the "$" anchor at the end indicates that the match must occur at the end of the string. 

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group of characters can occur.

In this regular expression, the "{6}" and "{3}" quantifiers specify that the preceding character class must occur exactly 6 or 3 times, respectively.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs are used to group together multiple characters or expressions. 

In this regular expression, the parentheses "()" group together the two options for the length of the hexadecimal color code, separated by the "|" (OR) operator.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions define a set of characters to match against. 

In this regular expression, the "[a-f0-9]" bracket expression defines a set of characters that can appear in the hexadecimal color code, specifically the letters a through f and the digits 0 through 9.

### Character Classes

Character classes are similar to bracket expressions, but allow for more complex patterns of characters. 

In this regular expression, there is no explicit character class, but the bracket expression "[a-f0-9]" can be considered a type of character class.

### The OR Operator

The "|" (OR) operator is used to specify alternatives for a match. 

In this regular expression, the "|" separates the two options for the length of the hexadecimal color code (6 or 3 characters).

### Flags

Flags are optional settings that modify the behavior of the expression. For example, the "g" flag can be used to perform a global search for multiple matches within a string. 

There are no flags used in this particular regular expression.

### Character Escapes

Character escapes are used to match special characters that would otherwise have a different meaning. For example, the backslash "" can be used to escape a special character like "." or "*" so that it is interpreted literally. 

There are no character escapes used in this particular regular expression.
