# REGEX-mach-ina

In this gist, I will be describing a regular expression pattern in Javascript.

## Summary

The regular expression pattern I will be describing is `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`. It is used to match hexadecimal color codes in the format of a "#" symbol, followed by either 3 or 6 characters.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify the position of a match within the string.

The "^" anchor used at the beginning of this regular expression indicates that the match must occur at the start of the string, and the "$" anchor at the end indicates that the match must occur at the end of the string.
